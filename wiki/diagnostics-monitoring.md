# üìä Diagnostic and Monitoring Strategy

This document outlines how diagnostic settings and monitoring are configured across the Azure DevTest Lab and associated infrastructure to ensure observability, compliance, and issue resolution capabilities.

---

## üß† Overview

Azure diagnostics and monitoring are critical for:
- Capturing logs and metrics from virtual machines, networks, and resources.
- Auditing system behaviors for compliance.
- Alerting for anomalies and operational issues.
- Enabling dashboards for visibility via Azure Monitor and Log Analytics.

## üîç Components

### 1. **Log Analytics Workspace**
- Central logging destination for all diagnostic data.
- Used for querying logs with Kusto Query Language (KQL).
- Enables cross-resource insights and centralized monitoring.

### 2. **Diagnostic Settings**
- Applied to:
  - Virtual Machines
  - Network Interfaces
  - Disks (optional)
- Categories include:
  - **Metrics**
  - **Boot Diagnostics**
  - **Guest OS Logs**
  - **Performance Counters**

### 3. **Azure Monitor Integration**
- Metrics are automatically collected and visualized via:
  - **Azure Monitor Metrics Explorer**
  - **Workbooks**
  - **Alerts** based on thresholds

## ‚öôÔ∏è Deployment Automation

### ‚úÖ Bicep Module
- **`diagnostic.bicep`** defines the diagnostic settings tied to Log Analytics Workspace.
- Accepts parameters:
  - `diagnosticsWorkspaceId`
  - Resource name/type for target VM or NIC

### üõ† PowerShell Automation
- **`enable-diagnostic.ps1`** script configures diagnostics post-deployment if needed.
  ```powershell
  .\enable-diagnostic.ps1 -resourceGroup "Dev_Test_Lab-demosmartcontract-vm-017910" `
                          -vmName "demosmartcontract-vm" `
                          -workspaceId "/subscriptions/<sub-id>/resourceGroups/<log-rg>/providers/Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/<workspace-name>"
